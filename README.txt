A Project to find the 5th Nearest Neighbor using KNN for non-linear data.

This Python script serves as an analytical tool within a comprehensive data analysis project. It begins with data exploration and summary statistics on a provided dataset, focusing on descriptive statistics like minimum, maximum, and interquartile range. Subsequently, it implements histogram generation based on varying bin widths, offering insights into data distribution.

Moving forward, it conducts data analysis on different groups within the dataset, examining their statistical properties and detecting outliers. Visual representations in the form of boxplots aid in understanding the data distribution and identifying potential anomalies.

In the latter part, the script tackles a classification task using a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. It performs eigenvalue decomposition and calculates a transformation matrix to project multidimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. The transformed data is then used to train a KNN classifier for fraud detection. The script concludes by predicting fraud probabilities for given input variables and determining the nearest neighbors of a new data point based on its transformed representation.

Overall, this project aims to provide insights into data distribution, identify outliers, and develop a predictive model for fraud detection leveraging machine learning techniques.
